Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the way we live and work. Machine learning, 
a subset of AI, enables computers to learn from data without explicit programming. 
Deep learning, a type of machine learning, uses neural networks inspired by the human brain.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that helps computers understand and 
process human language. It's used in applications like translation, chatbots, and text analysis.

Computer Vision is another important field in AI. It enables machines to understand and 
process visual information from the world, like images and videos. Applications include 
facial recognition, autonomous vehicles, and medical image analysis.

Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where agents learn by interacting 
with an environment. They receive rewards for good actions and penalties for bad ones. 
This is used in game playing, robotics, and autonomous systems.
