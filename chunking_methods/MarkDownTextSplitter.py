# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience. It focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is where the model is trained on a labeled dataset. The model learns to predict the output from the input data. Examples include:
- Classification
- Regression
- Neural Networks

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is where the model works on its own to discover patterns and information. Common examples include:
- Clustering
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Association

## Applications

Machine Learning has numerous real-world applications:
1. Image Recognition
2. Natural Language Processing
3. Recommendation Systems
4. Fraud Detection
